# Insertion Sort in JavaScript

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm. It works similarly to how we sort playing cards in our handsâ€”each new card is placed in the correct position relative to the sorted part.

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm.

## ðŸ›  How It Works

1. Start with the second element (`arr[1]`), since the first element (`arr[0]`) is already "sorted."
2. Compare `arr[i]` with elements in the sorted portion (`arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]`).
3. Shift larger elements to the right to create space.
4. Insert `arr[i]` into its correct position.
5. Repeat for all elements.

## ðŸ”¢ Understanding the Two Counters

The algorithm uses **two counters** to control the sorting process:

1. **`i` (Outer Loop Counter)** â†’ Tracks the current element being inserted.
2. **`j` (Inner Loop Counter)** â†’ Moves through the sorted portion to find the correct position for `arr[i]`.
